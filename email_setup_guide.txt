GMAIL APP PASSWORD SETUP GUIDE
==============================================

To send emails from your Django app, you need to create a Gmail App Password.
Regular Gmail passwords won't work due to security restrictions.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------

1. GO TO YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/
   - Make sure you're logged in as: siddhantjagtap0707@gmail.com

2. ENABLE 2-STEP VERIFICATION (if not already enabled)
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Click on "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the prompts to enable it (you'll need your phone)
   - This is REQUIRED before you can create App Passwords

3. CREATE APP PASSWORD
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - OR search for "App passwords" in your Google Account settings
   - Select app: Choose "Mail"
   - Select device: Choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - Enter name: "Restaurant Website"
   - Click "Generate"

4. COPY THE 16-CHARACTER PASSWORD
   - Google will show you a 16-character password like: "abcd efgh ijkl mnop"
   - Copy this password (without spaces)
   - IMPORTANT: You won't be able to see this password again!

5. UPDATE YOUR .env FILE
   - Open: c:\Users\DELL\Documents\Restaurant_project\.env
   - Find the line: EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password-here
   - Replace "your-gmail-app-password-here" with your 16-character password
   - Example: EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
   - Save the file

6. TEST THE EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY
   - Start your Django server: python manage.py runserver
   - Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/reservation/
   - Fill out the reservation form
   - Submit it
   - Check your email (siddhantjagtap0707@gmail.com) for notifications

==============================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
==============================================

Problem: "Authentication failed" error
Solution: Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password

Problem: "2-Step Verification required"
Solution: Enable 2-Step Verification first (Step 2 above)

Problem: Can't find App Passwords option
Solution: Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled first

Problem: Email not received
Solution: 
- Check spam folder
- Verify EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD in .env
- Check Django console for error messages

==============================================
SECURITY NOTES:
==============================================

✅ NEVER share your App Password with anyone
✅ NEVER commit the .env file to Git/GitHub
✅ The .env file should be in your .gitignore
✅ If you think your App Password is compromised, revoke it and create a new one
